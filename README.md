# file-vault

Quickly grab your favorite files -- from Github!

## Requirements

Before downloading files you need to specify the sources, which are the repository URLs. For that, either open `Settings > File Vault > Repositories` or include a key named `fileVault.repositories`, which is an array of strings.

## Usage

Just right click in any folder on the file explorer and select `Download files from vault`. After that, choose the desired repository, the files and you're done! The files should have been downloaded to the target folder, like in the example below:

After copying, please file an issue with general information about your environment, like:

- OS
